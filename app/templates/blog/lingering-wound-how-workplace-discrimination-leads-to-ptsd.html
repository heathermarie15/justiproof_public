But trauma comes in many forms, and with cases of discrimination and abuse in the workplace rising, it’s time for an increased focus on PTSD stemming from discrimination.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>The Unseen Trauma of Discrimination and Workplace Abuse</h3><p>Work is more than just a place we spend eight hours a day - it’s not uncommon to spend more time with those we work with than our own families and for many individuals, especially in the United States, our title has become a significant part of our identity. When discrimination or abuse occurs in this environment, it can tear at the very fabric of our self-worth and safety. It can shift our perception of the world and strip us of the motivation and joy we may have previously felt in our careers. As those around the victim shift to protect themselves or distance themselves to avoid becoming a target, the victim faces isolation and may become paranoid as they no longer trust their own judgment regarding who can be trusted.</p><p>Considering all of this, it’s not terribly surprising that a once motivated person may find they no longer believe that hard work will pay off and as a result, they lose the desire to blindly commit hours and time on faith that a promotion or reward will be forthcoming. This loss of direction, combined with a loss of identity is disorienting, but there is no time to process or cope, because the victim is not in a safe space to do so.</p><p>As a result, many victims shut down. During this period, a victim may refer to “being in a fog” or “being in a daze” – it’s not possible to process the grief, anger, despair and still function at work, so they must shut down emotionally. As a result they don’t feel the pain, they don’t process the loss and simultaneously they open themselves up to more suffering as they slowly retreat from their own life.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because it’s not possible to only shut down the negative feelings. To shut down emotionally and go into survival mode - you shut down joy, you shut down curiosity, you shut down hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Even then the toxic environment becomes all consuming, draining a victim of every ounce of energy left and leaving them with nothing to give loved ones even as they know deep down they desperately need those connections.</p><p>It is no wonder that sadly, many lose their lives to this fight.</p><p>However, even those of us who do survive, will find ourselves still struggling to move on long after we depart the workplace – then we enter a new battle, convincing others that yes, post-traumatic stress disorder can develop from discrimination or workplace abuse and no, I can’t just get over it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder After Discrimination or Workplace Abuse</h3><p>Workplace trauma, much like other forms of trauma, can lead to a range of symptoms that persist long after the discriminatory or abusive event has passed. Some common signs include:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hypervigilance</span>: Always being on edge, feelings of paranoia and a lack of trust. Even within a new workplace, you no longer trust your coworkers or leaders to be the people they are presenting themselves to be.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Avoidance</span>: Feeling anxious or fearful in a new place of employment. You may find yourself wondering when the first attack, slight or undermining action will come. &nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Intrusive Thoughts or Flashbacks</span>: Recurring memories of discriminatory incidents or moments of abuse that play over and over in the mind. You may no longer be able to easily dismiss minor incidents, because they trigger memories of abuse and a fear that this is a sign of worse things to come.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Emotional Numbness</span>: Becoming detached from work and your career. This can include losing enthusiasm even in a role you once loved and being hesitant to form relationships with colleagues in a new workplace.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Self-Doubt and Low Self-Esteem</span>: Repeated negative experiences can lead to questioning your abilities, worth, or even your right to exist in a certain space. Added to this is the realization that you are emotionally vulnerable and therefore more fearful that you will become exactly who your previous employer and / or abuser told you that you were. </li></ul><p>And these responses aren’t just emotional—they can manifest physically also, ranging from fatigue to headaches, and even long-term issues like high blood pressure or gastrointestinal problems.</p><p><br></p><h3>Why PTSD from Workplace Abuse is Often Overlooked</h3><p>Unlike trauma from a single, catastrophic event, workplace PTSD can be more subtle. Many victims of workplace discrimination or abuse endure a slow build-up of stress over months or years, sometimes not realizing the depth of their distress until they’re already in a state of emotional collapse. Even once they reach a breaking point, many victims are forced to remain in their place of employment, essentially stewing in their despair and trauma. This extended trauma can make it difficult to pinpoint when the breaking point occurred, resulting in many victims struggling to describe the traumatic experience and why they are left with such lasting negative consequences.</p><p>There’s also a societal stigma around recognizing workplace abuse as a valid form of trauma. Since it doesn’t fit into the neat boxes we associate with more traditional PTSD triggers, it is not uncommon for victims of workplace abuse to be told to “get over it.” This only adds to the suffering and isolation for victims, especially because very few people speak out about this form of trauma and as a result, there are limited connection opportunities for victims.&nbsp;</p><p id="isPasted">Because of this, finding the right support system is crucial. For me, I truly don’t know if I’d be here today if it wasn’t for the support system around me and an incredible, understanding psychiatrist. You cannot fight this battle alone, you cannot recover from this battle alone - seek the help you need, whether that’s professional help, connecting with others who’ve faced similar experiences, pursuing legal action or informing loved ones you need to be able to lean on them more than normal.&nbsp;</p><h3><br></h3><h3>My Story - Breaking the Silence and Finding Support</h3><p>My personal experience has shown me that recognizing and acknowledging the impact of workplace trauma is the first step in healing. It is important that as a victim, you are able to acknowledge that your pain is real and valid. You’re not overreacting, and you’re not alone. I can promise you - reclaiming your power is part of the healing journey. You don’t need to shout it on social media, nor do you need to fight them legally, but you do need to arrive at a place where you can accept what happened to you and be comfortable talking about it with those who love you and support you. By owning this part of your story, you begin to reclaim your power.&nbsp;</p><p>However, healing from workplace PTSD isn’t linear, and it’s important to give yourself the time and space to process what you’ve been through.</p><p>I still struggle with my PTSD. I could be having a great day when something triggers a memory and I suddenly find myself crying as I am transported back to the hurt and despair of that memory. I have not returned to work, nor have I applied to a single job. I don’t know when or if I will reach a point where I feel ready to work for another employer. I tell myself it’s extra motivation to forge my own path to success, but the truth is success is not certain. As a result, I still feel a sense of dread and anxiety when I consider that I may someday need to return to corporate america.</p><p>In the meantime - speaking up about my fight against discrimination and the psychological toll it took on me, has become an act of resistance. I believe that by acknowledging discrimination not only happens in the workplace, but that it can and does also lead to PTSD, we pave the way for better, safer working environments for everyone.&nbsp;</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
