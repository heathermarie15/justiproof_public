Many employees wonder whether escalating their concerns to HR or company leadership is worth it, especially if they believe their company’s culture is more inclined to ignore complaints — even valid complaints — than act.</p><p>And none of this is without cause. My personal experience demonstrated that escalating to HR and leadership not only leads to more disappointment and isolation, but increasing retaliation. However, I have heard from many who tried the opposite route — staying silent, keeping their head down and for every single one one of them, it still ended in losing their job. In this second scenario, saying nothing only made it easier for the discriminating party to manipulate the victims environment, damage the victim’s reputation and push the victim out.</p><p>The truth is, once discrimination starts, a happy ending for you is unlikely. I have heard from hundreds of women and the story of discrimination plays out the same at big and small companies, whether the person was just hired or has been employed for years.</p><p>Unfortunately, while escalating can be intimidating, it is often the only path to retaining any measure of control in an already unfair, unbalanced fight. By escalating to those with the power to protect you — HR and leadership — you give them the opportunity to help you. And if they don’t step in, you’ve gained powerful evidence that proves the company’s negligence.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore why escalating your concerns to HR or company leadership is a necessary step.</p><h3>1. Documenting the Issue for Legal Purposes</h3><p>In most workplace discrimination cases, you must prove you exhausted the internal complaint process. By escalating your concerns to HR or company leadership you’re not only following the process expected of you, you’re building evidence for your case. By raising the issue in writing, you create a paper trail that can be invaluable if you decide to take legal action.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Establishes a record</span>: Each time you escalate, the date / time is captured, creating a timeline that ties escalations to ongoing discrimination and retaliation.</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Demonstrates good faith</span>: It proves that before you sought external intervention, you gave the company multiple opportunities to address and resolve the problem.</li></ul><h3>2. Establishing That the Company Knew and Did Nothing</h3><p>One of the most important elements of a discrimination lawsuit is proving that your employer was aware of the issue and failed to act. Escalating your concerns to HR or leadership gives them the chance to investigate and take corrective measures. But if they fail to do so, they strengthen your case, because you now have evidence that they knowingly ignored the problem and their negligence allowed the harm to continue.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shows company inaction</span>: If your complaints are ignored, this strengthens the argument that the company was negligent.</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Legally required step</span>: Many courts require proof that the employer had knowledge of the issue and an opportunity to fix it before allowing a lawsuit to proceed.</li></ul><h3>3. Strengthening Your Retaliation Claim</h3><p>Unfortunately, retaliation is a common experience for employees who report discrimination. The one piece of good news (if you can call it that) is the retaliation — demotion, exclusion from projects, or even termination — strengthens you legal claim. In many cases, the retaliation itself becomes a separate legal violation.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Creates additional legal claims</span>: Retaliation can be just as damaging as the initial discrimination and is a separate basis for legal action.</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Helps demonstrate causality</span>: Multiple escalations followed by negative treatment help connect your complaints to the retaliation.</li></ul><h3>4. Giving the Company a Chance to Correct the Issue</h3><p>Escalating concerns gives your employer the chance to correct the issue. While it may be frustrating to continue escalating without seeing immediate results, it’s important to give your company an opportunity to address the discrimination. If the company takes corrective action, it may resolve the issue without legal intervention. On the other hand, if the company continues to ignore the problem, you have stronger grounds for a lawsuit.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Avoids premature litigation</span>: Giving the company a chance to address the issue can sometimes lead to resolution without needing to go to court.</li><li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Strengthens your legal argument</span>: If they don’t act after multiple escalations, you demonstrate that you tried to resolve the issue before taking legal action.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Filing a lawsuit against your company is a serious step and&nbsp;it is not easy to get the legal help you’ll need. Yes there are legal resources that exist, but proving to them that you should be prioritized over the thousands of other cases brought to them requires demonstrating that not only did a person or persons discriminate against you, but that multiple individuals who were in a position to step in and protect you from harm, failed to act.</p><p>It’s also not enough to say it happened, you need a paper trail / evidence that confirms your claims. This requires that you not only captured your concerns and escalations in writing, but that you have access to them at the time you are seeking legal action. If evidence exists, but you no longer have access to it following your termination or resignation, it might as well not exist for the good it will do you in seeking or obtaining legal justice.</p><p>You must capture the evidence in writing and then save that evidence on a personal device or personal cloud account. Why? The company is not going to give you evidence to pursue legal charges against them. Yes, they could be compelled to by a judge, but you’ll need to convince that judge to rule in your favor with no actual evidence that your evidence exists.</p><p>As with all things, there are exceptions to this — for example if you have enough witnesses or defendants making the same claims, but the safest route is operating on the side of caution and capturing each piece of evidence as if you could be terminated tomorrow.</p><h3>JustiProof Can Help</h3><p>We know this fight can be overwhelming and exhausting and that’s why we built <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-87ff-5" href="https://www.justiproof.com" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span class="u-text-custom-color-5" style="text-decoration: underline;">JustiProof</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> a tool that empowers you to continuously record incidents as they happen, capturing both evidence and which parties discriminated, retaliated or failed to act.</p><p>With <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.justiproof.com"></a></span><span class="u-text-custom-color-5"><a href="https://www.justiproof.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JustiProof</span></a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>you can begin building your timeline without needing to worry about capturing incidents in order or having everything you need in one sitting, because you can always go back and update or add information as needed.
