Unfortunately, this also means if a new peer enters the group exhibiting or expressing complicit bias, it can create a ripple effect that normalizes biased behavior, even among those who have never given any indication that they harbored such views.&nbsp;</p><p>This collective reinforcement of bias then makes discrimination much more difficult to identify, especially when that reinforcement is coming from people you trust or respect - your mentors, your advocates, your friends. Like me, the trust you place in these individuals can cloud your judgment, making it difficult to recognize that their actions—or lack of action—are contributing to an unfair or discriminatory environment. As a result, discrimination becomes more insidious as your close bonds with colleagues forces you to question your own perceptions, leading to self-doubt or dismissal of valid concerns.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>How can justiproof and documentation help?</h3><p>The complexity of these situations and the emotions involved as you reconcile what you believe you know about a person with what their actions indicate makes awareness and vigilance even more important. For me, I continued to believe I was the problem until I wrote down and was faced with the facts. It was only then, through objective documentation that I was able to recognize and accept that those I once trusted had become contributors to the discrimination &nbsp;and retaliation. I had to accept that they were no longer allies and would likely never be again. Perhaps they had unknowingly started down the path and felt they had no other choice, but to defend their actions once they arrived or perhaps they had always been this way and it was a matter of when, not if, their bias would make itself known. Ultimately it doesn't matter, because once they've engaged in the behavior, they are unlikely to ever admit it for the discrimination or retaliation it was.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not easy coming to terms with any of this, but there is relief in no longer having to doubt and question what is happening around you. For me, I could finally see the situation for what it actually was and I could finally identify the individuals who had turned themselves into enemies. I still couldn't stop the attacks, but at least now I knew where they were coming from.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you're in this situation, we want to help you do the same. We know there is nothing that will make any of this easier for you, so we won't pretend we can. Instead justiproof offer's a path to restoring your sanity and to removing the lingering self doubt. We want to ensure you have the objective facts as they so you can choose the path that makes the most sense for you.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're interested in learning more: <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-f6e2-5" href="https://www.justiproof.com/Contact-Us" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="u-text-custom-color-1">Contact Us</span></span></a></p><p><br></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
