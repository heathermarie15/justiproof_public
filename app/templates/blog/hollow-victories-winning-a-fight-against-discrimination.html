I just knew something was off.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I realized I was fighting against discrimination, I believed it was possible to win this fight, but only because I hadn’t yet asked myself what “winning” would look like. What would make me feel better about what happened? Was there any punishment that would make me feel like justice had been served?</p><p>It turns out the answer was nothing and no. To better explain, I’ll cover some of the “wins” I’ve experienced.</p><p><br></p><h3>Win 1: Legal Representation and A Fight for Justice</h3><p>It doesn’t feel like winning when you retain an attorney, even if they’re working on contingency. Yes, it’s a relief to have someone in your corner—especially when you no longer trust anyone internally to protect you.&nbsp;</p><p>But it also means the fight has escalated and enough damage has been done that your attorney believes there’s recovery owed for the emotional and financial toll you’ve suffered.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, as you go through the legal process, you realize that not only are internal policies designed to protect the employer, but the legal system itself feels stacked against you. The emotional and mental weight of what’s happened becomes overwhelming, and the discussion around compensation starts to feel hollow.</p><p>You’re barely holding it together mentally, you’re emotionally drained, and &nbsp;your career may never be the same. You know money won’t erase the sleepless nights, the anxiety, or the deep sense of injustice.&nbsp;</p><p>You want accountability. You want an apology. You want acknowledgement. You want them to listen and promise this will never happen to anyone else again. Or if not, you want the consequences to be significant enough that they’ll never do this again, but the truth is it’s unlikely any dollar amount you’d ask for will make a dent in the finances of a publicly traded company. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Win 2: Terminations</h3><p>There have been multiple people who left the company since this fight started</p><ul><li>A director I filed an HR complaint against abruptly “moved on” while I was on FMLA</li><li>A VP was laid off after I exposed the manipulative role she played in my fight to her boss</li><li>A Senior VP whom I escalated to three times - including weeks before I was forced to leave - recently retired. He will be replaced by a female.</li></ul><p>These are the facts. I may have influenced their departures, but even if that’s true, they are not “wins” I want attributed to me. Why? Because I did not force a single person to act the way they did and if those actions (or lack of action) resulted in their departures, only an individual with a broken moral compass would still choose to blame the messenger.</p><p>Is there a moment of justice in their exits? Maybe. But it’s fleeting and shallow.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Win 3: Damage to the Brand</h3><p>I didn’t speak out against my company for a “win.” In fact, it was only in my defeat and in believing I had nothing left to lose, that I found the courage to make one last stand.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, I had decided that I wouldn’t hide the reason I left from future employers, even though I knew that saying the word "discrimination" would mark me as a risk to any future potential employer.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this meant I was unlikely to find future employment anyways, I decided there was no additional damage to be done by sharing my story publicly in an attempt to prevent the company’s HR from gaslighting other employee’s to the point that they also questioned their own reality. Perhaps in this, I could limit someone else’s suffering and prevent someone else from feeling so alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Then LinkedIn did something amazing — through the power of a community who believed me and amplified my voice, that post was seen by over 1 million people.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not naive enough to think I made a lasting impact on a company that would rather dismiss me as a problem, but I am glad that they will never again be able to make someone feel as if they are the first or the only.&nbsp;</p><p>It has also allowed me to connect with so many new women, who have been as much a support to me as I’ve tried to be to them.</p><p>As my final act of defeat, it became a powerful collective win.</p><p><br></p><h3>What An Actual Win Would Look Like</h3><p>What I want is something that rarely comes, even with a legal “win.”I want an apology. I want acknowledgement.</p><p>But if that never comes, I will settle for the day when I stop hearing from people at the company who commiserate and finally hear from the one who tells me the company listened and they finally did better.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p id="isPasted">If you're in this situation, we know you're facing the same impossible options. &nbsp;There is nothing that will make any of this easier for you, so we won't pretend we can. However, justiproof can help you restore you sanity in the face of consistent gaslighting.
